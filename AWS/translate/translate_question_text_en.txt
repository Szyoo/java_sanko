10/30 Sunday

I woke up at 8 a.m. today to do the cleaning and laundry.

I ate apples for breakfast and studied until noon.

I ate soba for lunch.

I spent the daytime reading books after playing games.

I went to bed at 11:00 p.m., but I couldn't sleep easily, and in the end I went to bed at 0:00.
